Work off of the Basechar, Mage, and Warrior classes we are working on in class.

try to add a constructor to Basechar that takes a parameter to set a name. Can you do this?								  
// Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Basechar: method <init>()V not found
//         at Warrior.<init>(Warrior.java:2)
//         at Driver.main(Driver.java:7)
add a zero parameter constructor that sets some default name.
// works
Remove those constructors and add the following to Mage, one at a time.
a constructor that sets the name
a zero parameter one
One that sets the name and mana.
Can you make constructors in Mage without ones in Basechar? Do you need them all to match? Try to discover the rules.
