Work off of the Basechar, Mage, and Warrior classes we are working on in class.

try to add a constructor to Basechar that takes a parameter to set a name. Can you do this?								  
// Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Basechar: method <init>()V not found
//         at Warrior.<init>(Warrior.java:2)
//         at Driver.main(Driver.java:7)
// Why doesn't this work?????
add a zero parameter constructor that sets some default name.
// works

Remove those constructors and add the following to Mage, one at a time.
a constructor that sets the name
// works
a zero parameter one
// works
One that sets the name and mana. // Note-mana is spelled manna in the code
// works
Can you make constructors in Mage without ones in Basechar? Do you need them all to match? Try to discover the rules.
// yes you can. What do you mean by "match"?????
